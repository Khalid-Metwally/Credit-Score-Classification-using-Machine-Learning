# Credit-Score-Classification-using-Machine-Learning
The Credit Score Classification project aimed to develop a comprehensive solution for classifying credit scores using machine learning techniques. The project analyzed various attributes, such as income, debt-to-income ratio, credit history length, and number of credit inquiries, to determine an individual's creditworthiness. Different classification algorithms, including decision trees, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, and support vector machines (SVM) with linear and RBF kernels, were employed. Extensive data preprocessing techniques, such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features, were applied. Additionally, feature selection using mutual information (MI) scores and dimensionality reduction with principal component analysis (PCA) were implemented. The models' performance was evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the curve (AUC). Hyperparameter tuning and k-fold cross-validation were conducted to optimize model performance and prevent overfitting. The results indicated that the decision tree classifier performed best among the evaluated models, achieving a testing accuracy of 91%, demonstrating the efficacy of the approach in accurately classifying credit scores and aiding financial institutions in making informed lending decisions.
